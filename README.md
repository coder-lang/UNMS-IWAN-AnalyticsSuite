# UNMS-IWAN-AnalyticsSuite

## Description
The IWAN Report Visualizer is a tool designed to help users visualize and download various reports related to the Airtel IWAN (Integrated Wide Area Network) project.
This project involved the strategic collection of Performance Monitoring (PM) and Fault Management (FM) data from 250,000 UBR (Universal Broadband Router) devices in the field. 
The data, obtained through SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol), was stored in a MySQL server. 
The primary aim of this project was to leverage insights from this data for network optimization.


## Features
- **Deep Dive into KPIs**: Explore Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and visualize them for enhanced insights into network performance.
- **CTO-Level Dashboards**: High-level dashboards tailored for CTOs to highlight critical network issues for strategic decision-making.
- **Device Relationships**: Visualize the relationships between devices to understand their connections and interactions.
- **IP Address Integration**: Device IP addresses provided for easy identification and tracking.
- **Data Extraction with SNMP Protocol**: Utilizes SNMP protocol for efficient data extraction from devices.
- **Task Scheduling with NiFi**: Schedule tasks and automate data processing workflows using NiFi.
- **Data Storage and Processing with HDFS and Spark**: Store and process data efficiently using Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Apache Spark.
- **MySQL Integration**: Data stored in MySQL, with reports generated using Stored Procedures (SPs) for easy access via UNMS dashboard.
- **Report Visualization**: Visualize reports within the UNMS dashboard for comprehensive data analysis and decision-making.
